This file describes the use of inst/extdata/index.Rmd

index.Rmd is used as a template Rmarkdown to generate parameterized reports.
It collates all the output of template.Rmd into a table of contents, and acts
as a 'landing page'.

Users should not concern themselves with index.Rmd and is taken care of automatically
by abseqR.
