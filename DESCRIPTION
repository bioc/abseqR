Description: AbSeq is a comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of sequencing datasets 
    generated from antibody libraries and abseqR is one of its packages. abseqR empowers the users 
    of abseqPy (https://github.com/malhamdoosh/abseqPy) with plotting and reporting capabilities and
    allows them to generate interactive HTML reports for the convenience of viewing and sharing with 
    other researchers. Additionally, abseqR extends abseqPy to compare multiple
    repertoire analyses and perform further downstream analysis on its output.
